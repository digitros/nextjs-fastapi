<p align="center">Simple Next.js boilerplate that uses BOTH <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> AND NEXTJS 13 as the API backend unlike <a href="https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi" >the example offered by NextJS</a>

## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses a fullstack Next.js application and FastAPI as another API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/py/`(easily changeable) and the NextJS is mapped to `/api/`.


This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/py/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpsycho-baller%2Fnextjs-and-fastapi-backend%2Ftree%2Fmain)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/psycho-baller/nextjs-and-fastapi-backend"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies for the FastAPI server:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
